# TGPy snippets

This repository contains some useful snippets for [TGPy userbot](https://github.com/tm-a-t/tgpy). Feel free to use them in your TGPy.

## Repository structure

- `functions` directory contains useful functions
- `commands` directory contains useful functions designed to be used directly via user, not in code. They all can be used without parentheses (this magic is done via `Command` decorator)
- `decorators` directory contains useful decorators which allows to define custom functions and commands easily
